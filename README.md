# Google App Scripts Early Morning Event Reminder

A Google App Script that adds notification reminders for the previous day when you have early events.

I missed an appointment one morning because I forgot to check my calendar the night before.
This script will, for meetings before 9:00 AM, automatically add a reminder for the night before (11:00 PM).
